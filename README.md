# AiSurf: *A*utomated *I*dentification of *Surf*ace images
AiSurf is an open-source package for analizing surface microscopy images. New functionalities are added with time.
The main advantage of AiSurf is that it exploits unsupervised techniques, so it doesn't require any image database for training, which is a bottleneck for many image classification programs. No programming skills are required to use this tool, only the istructions written in the *Usage* sections of the respective notebooks need to be followed. <br>

These are the current available methods: <br>
*Lattice Extraction* aims to inspect and classify atomically-resolved images (like AFM and STM) via Scale Invariant Feature Transform [(SIFT)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94) and Clustering Algorithms, inspired by the work of [Laanait et al](https://ascimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40679-016-0028-8). <br>
Lattice Extraction extracts primitive lattice vectors, unit cells, and structural distortions from the original image, with no pre-assumption on the lattice and minimal user intervention.

*Atom Counting* allows to count features on images through a template-matching procedure. It is a natural extension of Lattice Extraction and it is typically used to count atoms on surface images.

## Usage - Lattice Extraction {#usage_lattice_extr}
### General setup
In order to start the lattice recognition process, image and simulation parameters need to be set. This can be done in the following ways:
* Create a folder where image, parameters file and results will be stored. In this repository, such folders are inside the [experiments](https://github.com/QuantumMaterialsModelling/Lattice-Symmetry-Recognition/tree/master/experiments) folder;
* Specify the path (relative to the notebook) and the image name at the beginning of the IPython notebook [lattice_extraction.ipynb](https://github.com/QuantumMaterialsModelling/Lattice-Symmetry-Recognition/blob/master/lattice_extraction.ipynb). For example, the third cell of the notebook reads: <br>
```
# Insert path + filename here:
path = "experiments/lattice_extraction/SrTiO3(001)/"
filename = "small SrTiO3_1244.png"
```

### Parameters file setup {#parameters_lattice_extr}
The parameters file, *parameters.ini* is the file containing all the parameters needed to run the simulation. It must be put inside the image folder, but if not provided some default parameters will be used instead; such parameters are found at the beginning of the IPython Notebook file. This section will describe the meaning of each parameter; suggestions regarding the parameter tuning are inserted in the Notebook, just before they are used. Images in the [experiments](https://github.com/QuantumMaterialsModelling/Lattice-Symmetry-Recognition/tree/master/experiments) folder of this repository can also be used as a reference for parameter tuning.

[*SIFT*] <br>
Three main parameters of the SIFT algorithm, well explained in the [original article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94) by Lowe and in [this link](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.4/d7/d60/classcv_1_1SIFT.html).
- **contrast_threshold**: the contrast threshold used to filter out weak features. Higher threshold means more discarded features. *Default: 0.003*;
- **sigma**: the sigma of the Gaussian applied to the input image at the first octave. *Default: 4*;
- **noctavelayers**: the number of layers in each octave. The number of octaves is computed automatically from the image resolution. *Default: 8*.

[*Keypoint filtering*] <br>
These are thresholds to filter out [keypoints](https://paperswithcode.com/task/keypoint-detection) ("kp") that could cause issues in the lattice identification process, in units of the median keypoint size.
- **size_threshold**: if kp_size > median*size_threshold or kp_size < median/size_threshold the keypoint is deleted. *Default: 2*;
- **edge_threshold**: all keypoints that are closer than median\*edge_threshold to one border of the image are deleted. *Default: 1*.

[*Keypoint Clustering*] <br>
Clusterings with *n* clusters between lower and upper bound are evaluated with respect to their [silhouette score](https://towardsdatascience.com/silhouette-coefficient-validating-clustering-techniques-e976bb81d10c); the one with the maximal silhouette score is chosen for further processing.
- **cluster_kp_low** and **cluster_kp_high**: values defining the interval containing the optimal number of different clusters found in the image, evaluated by calculating the silhouette score. *Default: 2 and 12 respectively*, they define the variable *clustering_span_kp*;
- **cluster_choice**: number that selects the chosen reference cluster for the second part of the analysis. The value of *1* indicates the *first*/*most populated cluster*, so *2* selects the *second* most populated one and so on. *Default: 1*.

[*Nearest Neighbours*] <br>
Parameters related to the clustering processes used to find the primitive vectors.
- **cluster_kNN_low** and **cluster_kNN_high**: values defining the interval containing the optimal number of clusters for the calculated nearest neighbours (NN) distances, evaluated by the silhouette score. *Default: 6 and 24 respectively*; they define the variable *cluster_span_kNN*. <br>
**cluster_kNN_low** is also the number of NN considered for each keypoint during the calculations.
- **clustersize_Threshold**: used to reduce impact of erroneous NN-vectors on the selection of the lattice vectors. In the final distribution only nn-clusters with population â‰¥ clustersize_threshold\*n_max are considered; n_max is the population of the largest cluster; *Default: 0.3*.

[*Sublattice lookup*] <br>
Once the primitive vectors have been found, we look for the sublattice positions.
- **cluster_SUBL_low** and **cluster_SUBL_high**: values defining the interval containing the optimal number of sublattice positions. *Default: 2 and 6 respectively*; they define the variable *clustering_span_SUBL*.

[*Deviation plot*] <br>
Parameters related to the perfect-lattice-deviations plot.
- **k2**: number of nearest neighbors considered for each keypoint. *Default: 10*;
- **rtol_rel**: all vectors that are within the relative_r-tolerance of the lattice vectors are drawn; *Default: 4* (pixels);
- **arrow_width**: the arrow_width can be specified (see [matplotlib.quiver() - width parameter](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.quiver.html)). *Default: 0.003*;
- **c_max_arrow**: deviation (in pixels) of a lattice vector with respect to the predicted one. Needed to tune the visualization of bond deviations, purely aesthetic. *Default: None*.

## Usage - Atom Counting
Refer to the [Usage](#usage_lattice_extr) section of Lattice Extraction.

### Parameters file setup
Other than the [parameters](#parameters_lattice_extr) introduced for Lattice Extraction, new ones have been introduced.

[*Atom count*] <br>
- **r_rescale**: rescales the median features' radius. Used to variate the impact of the atomic neighborhood on the correlation map. Recommended value: between 0.8 and 1.2.
- **min_correl**: filter out the peaks below this value from the correlation map. Use to reduce the outliers from the peak detection/atom counting. Recommended value: between 0.4 and 0.6.
- **d_rescale**: recales the accepted minimum distance between the features, which is equal to half of the median crop's size. The features' filtering process takes care of most of the outliers, and the default value of 0.8 never needed to be modified.
