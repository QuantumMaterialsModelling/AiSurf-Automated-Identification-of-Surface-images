# AiSurf: *A*utomated *I*dentification of *Surf*ace images

AiSurf is a tool which aims to inspect and classify atomically-resolved images (like AFM and STM) via Scale Invariant Feature Transform [(SIFT)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94) and Clustering Algorithms, inspired by the work of [Laanait et al](https://ascimaging.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40679-016-0028-8). <br>
The main advantage of AiSurf is that it exploits unsupervised machine learning techniques, so it doesn't require any image database for training, which is a bottleneck for many image classification programs. It can be executed by office computers/laptops with a typical calculation time of 30-60 seconds. No programming skills are required to use this tool, only the istructions written in the [Usage](#usage) section need to be followed. <br>
AiSurf extracts primitive lattice vectors, unit cells, and structural distortions from the original image, with no pre-assumption on the lattice and minimal user intervention.

### Dependencies
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* SciPy
* Scikit-learn (sklearn)
* Python Image Library (PIL)
* OpenCV


## Usage
### General setup
In order to start the lattice recognition process, image and simulation parameters need to be set. This can be done in the following way:
* Create a folder where image, parameters file and results will be stored. In this repository, such folders are inside the [experiments](https://github.com/QuantumMaterialsModelling/Lattice-Symmetry-Recognition/tree/master/experiments) folder;
* Specify the path (relative to the notebook) and the image name at the beginning of the IPython notebook [lattice_extraction.ipynb](https://github.com/QuantumMaterialsModelling/Lattice-Symmetry-Recognition/blob/master/lattice_extraction.ipynb). For example, the third cell of the notebook reads: <br>
```
# Insert path + filename here:
path = "experiments/SrTiO3(001)/"
filename = "small SrTiO3_1244.png"
```
### Parameters file setup
The parameters file, *parameters.ini* is the file containing all the parameters needed to run the simulation. It must be put inside the image folder, but if not provided some default parameters will be used instead; such parameters are found at the beginning of the IPython Notebook file. This section will describe the meaning of each parameter; suggestions regarding the parameter tuning are inserted in the Notebook, just before they are used. Images in the [experiments](https://github.com/QuantumMaterialsModelling/Lattice-Symmetry-Recognition/tree/master/experiments) folder of this repository can also be used as a reference for parameter tuning.

[*SIFT*] <br>
Three main parameters of the SIFT algorithm, well explained in the [original article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94) by Lowe and in [this link](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.4/d7/d60/classcv_1_1SIFT.html).
- **contrast_threshold**: the contrast threshold used to filter out weak features. Higher threshold means more discarded features. *Default: 0.003*;
- **sigma**: the sigma of the Gaussian applied to the input image at the first octave. *Default: 4*;
- **noctavelayers**: the number of layers in each octave. The number of octaves is computed automatically from the image resolution. *Default: 8*.

[*Keypoint filtering*] <br>
These are thresholds to filter out [keypoints](https://paperswithcode.com/task/keypoint-detection) ("kp") that could cause issues in the lattice identification process, in units of the median keypoint size.
- **size_threshold**: if kp_size > median*size_threshold or kp_size < median/size_threshold the keypoint is deleted. *Default: 2*;
- **edge_threshold**: all keypoints that are closer than median\*edge_threshold to one border of the image are deleted. *Default: 1*.

[*Keypoint Clustering*] <br>
Clusterings with *n* clusters between lower and upper bound are evaluated with respect to their [silhouette score](https://towardsdatascience.com/silhouette-coefficient-validating-clustering-techniques-e976bb81d10c); the one with the maximal silhouette score is chosen for further processing.
- **cluster_kp_low** and **cluster_kp_high**: values defining the interval containing the optimal number of different clusters found in the image, evaluated by calculating the silhouette score. *Default: 2 and 12 respectively*, they define the variable *clustering_span_kp*;
- **cluster_choice**: number that selects the chosen reference cluster for the second part of the analysis. The value of *1* indicates the *first*/*most populated cluster*, so *2* selects the *second* most populated one and so on. *Default: 1*.

[*Nearest Neighbours*] <br>
Parameters related to the clustering processes used to find the primitive vectors.
- **cluster_kNN_low** and **cluster_kNN_high**: values defining the interval containing the optimal number of clusters for the calculated nearest neighbours (NN) distances, evaluated by the silhouette score. *Default: 6 and 24 respectively*; they define the variable *cluster_span_kNN*. <br>
**cluster_kNN_low** is also the number of NN considered for each keypoint during the calculations.
- **clustersize_Threshold**: used to reduce impact of erroneous NN-vectors on the selection of the lattice vectors. In the final distribution only nn-clusters with population â‰¥ clustersize_threshold\*n_max are considered; n_max is the population of the largest cluster; *Default: 0.3*.

[*Sublattice lookup*] <br>
Once the primitive vectors have been found, we look for the sublattice positions.
- **cluster_SUBL_low** and **cluster_SUBL_high**: values defining the interval containing the optimal number of sublattice positions. *Default: 2 and 6 respectively*; they define the variable *clustering_span_SUBL*.

[*Deviation plot*] <br>
Parameters related to the perfect-lattice-deviations plot.
- **k2**: number of nearest neighbors considered for each keypoint. *Default: 10*;
- **rtol_rel**: all vectors that are within the relative_r-tolerance of the lattice vectors are drawn; *Default: 4* (pixels);
- **arrow_width**: the arrow_width can be specified (see [matplotlib.quiver() - width parameter](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.quiver.html)). *Default: 0.003*;
- **c_max_arrow**: deviation (in pixels) of a lattice vector with respect to the predicted one. Needed to tune the visualization of bond deviations, purely aesthetic. *Default: None*.
